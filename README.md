# Library-Phase-One-Assignment-2020

## Instructions:

- Clone this repository into your local `~/code` directory.

- Initialize npm in your new local repository.

- Install the `parcel-bundler` npm package.

- Create your file structure. [See example structure here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11NtcCcDG2fkXCbgA2YRrK77mt9W42mSo2Tq8AahwtUk/edit).

- Add, commit, and push your initial changes.

- Build out your HTML structure and BEM + SCSS styling, based on the [Library Project Wireframes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z8iGpt6CXeVkP9Ii7sbFsvrQQXSX8mDv).

- Remember to view your code locally using Parcel; without it your SCSS wonâ€™t work!

- Note: No JavaScript functionality should be completed in Phase I; the focus should be on building out static HTML structure and reusable, best-practices styles using BEM + SCSS.

- **HINT:** Run `parcel *.html` through your command line. This will allow you to access each of your HTML files from the browser via http://localhost:1234/filenamehere.html.
